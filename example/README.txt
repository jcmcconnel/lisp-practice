Fun with Lisp!
I have been trying to learn Lisp also.

Lisp is VERY different than many of the languages in common use today.  

The easiest way to run this program is in a Linux environment with 'sbcl': Steel-Bank Common Lisp installed.
You can use the command: 

$ sbcl --script example.lsp

Or if you like using the REPL (Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop; Similar to the Python interpreter...):
Start the REPL by running: 

$ sbcl

Then type: 

$ (load "example.lsp")

The program will run like normal.
When you want to exit, type: 

$ (exit)

Enjoy!
